# BusMall User Stories (MVP)

## Marketing Research Team
- I want to be able to track which products interest users the most
- I want to see two previously clicked products 'square off' to see what's most desirable
- I want the images to be fresh, to "pop" so to speak, so users stay engaged
- I want analytics, not only what was clicked but also what wasn't
- I want to collect demographic info of the users (stretch goal)

## Focus Group Participant
- I want to see cool products
- I want it to be like a game (if possible)
- I want to see what I clicked on, the tally, at the end
- I want to see different products (random)
- I don't want to spend a lot of time doing this marketing research

## The Developer
- I want my object constructor, arrays, and all global variables at the beginning of my code
- I want informative comments outlining what's occurring
- I don't want my code to repeat
- I want to adequately meet all technical requirements
- I want the code to work, and have it clear enough that other developers can work on it too
